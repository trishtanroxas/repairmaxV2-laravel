                <p class="mb-4">Before bringing or shipping your mobile device to Repairmax for diagnostics or repair, we recommend taking the following steps to protect your personal information and ensure a fast service turnaround:</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">1. Back Up Your Data</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Always create a full backup of your phone\'s data to iCloud (for iOS devices) or Google Drive (for Android devices). While our standard repairs (like screen or battery replacements) rarely cause data loss, unforeseen hardware interactions can occur, and having a secure backup keeps your data safe.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">2. Remove SIM Cards & MicroSD Cards</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Remove your physical SIM card and any external MicroSD memory cards. Keep them safely at home. If you use an eSIM, there is no need to delete or disable it.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">3. Remove Protective Cases and Accessories</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Take off any protective cases, phone grips, ring holders, or plug-in accessories. These can obstruct our technicians\' tools and assembly fixtures.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">4. Verify Power Status</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">If possible, charge your device to at least 30% power. This allows our technicians to run pre-repair diagnostics immediately upon receiving your phone.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">5. Note Your Device Serial/IMEI Number</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Write down your device Serial Number or IMEI code (found by dialing *#06# or checking your SIM tray). This helps you easily verify your booking status.</p>
            '

                <p class="mb-4">When our professional technicians inspect your phone, they run an exhaustive 24-point diagnostic suite and generate an official Repairmax Diagnostics Report. Here is how to interpret your report findings:</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">1. Primary Failure Description</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">This highlights the core issue you booked for (e.g. "Cracked front digitizer glass", "Battery health at 74% with voltage instability"). This is the main focus of our repair plan.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">2. Secondary Checks (Green/Yellow/Red status)</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong class="text-green-400">Green (Passed):</strong> Component functions within normal manufacturer tolerances (e.g. front camera, Wi-Fi module, charging port pin health).</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-yellow-400">Yellow (Notice):</strong> Component shows wear or minor degradation but is still functional (e.g. slight display burn-in, weak vibration motor). Repairs are optional.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-red-400">Red (Failed):</strong> Component is broken, missing, or causing electrical short-circuits. Requires immediate attention to prevent system failure.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">3. Next Steps & Approval</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">No repair is initiated without your explicit approval. The report will outline the exact parts cost and labor breakdown. You can choose to approve or reject proposed repairs directly through your booking dashboard or by replying to our SMS/email support line.</p>

            'content' => '
                <p class="mb-4">Liquid damage is time-critical. As corrosion sets in, the likelihood of a successful repair decreases. If your phone has been exposed to water, coffee, or salt water, follow these critical emergency steps immediately:</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">1. Power Off Immediately</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Do not attempt to check if the phone is working. If it is on, turn it off right away. If it is already off, leave it off. Running electrical current through wet circuits causes immediate short-circuits and permanent chip damage.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">2. Dry the Exterior</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Wipe the device with a clean microfiber cloth or towel. Gently shake the phone to expel excess water from the charging port, speaker grilles, and headphone jack.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">3. Remove Trays & Accessories</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Take out the SIM tray immediately to let air enter. Remove any phone cases, screen protectors, or plug covers.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">4. Do NOT Use Rice or Hair Dryers</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Contrary to popular belief, raw rice does not dry out internal phone components quickly enough, and it deposits fine starch dust that damages mechanical parts. Hair dryers are even worse, as their heat melts interior adhesive and blows moisture deeper inside the device.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">5. Deliver to Repairmax Desk</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">Bring your device to our service desk as soon as possible. Our technicians will open the device, perform a professional chemical wash to remove water residue, and replace components that have failed due to corrosion.</p>
